<div class="margin">
<p>Suicideboys is an American hip hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and Scrim. Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. The duo's first project together, a three-track EP named Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga, was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper Bones. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the Kill Yourself series. After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full-length project titled Gray/Grey was released on March 3, 2015.

Suicideboys' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP $outh $ide $uicide, a collaboration with established South Florida rapper Pouya, which thrust the duo into the underground rap spotlight. As of October 2018, the tape has gained over 75 million track plays on streaming platform SoundCloud alone. The duo's first foray onto the mainstream musical charts came with the release of Radical $uicide in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP, produced by EDM musician Getter, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Rap charts.

</p><p>On September 7, 2018, their debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released. A statement posted by the duo's official Instagram account stated, "We started recording this album in the beginning of 2017. Initially we wanted to write about our experiences on the road and express how our lives had become slightly more extravagant."

Suicideboys have gained a cult following in the hip hop scene, in part due to their niche subject matter involving subjects scarcely seen in rap such as suicidal ideation, satanism and depression. As of August 2021, their most viewed music video on YouTube is for their song Paris, reaching nearly 150 million views; Kill Yourself (Part III) is the song with the most plays on their Spotify page, with 322 million plays. The duo were featured in Billboard's list titled "Billboard Dance's 15 Artists to Watch in 2017".</p>

<p>In late 2018, a rumor arose that the group had broken up following a series of ominous tweets. However, they soon clarified that the tweets were in relation to "personal issues" facing Arceneaux, and that they had in fact not broken up.

In May 2019, the group put this rumor to rest with the release of their six-track EP Live Fast, Die Whenever in collaboration with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, and prominently featuring Korn guitarist James Shaffer.

In July 2019, the duo started their first nationwide "Grey Day Tour", with guests Germ, City Morgue, Trash Talk, Denzel Curry, Shoreline Mafia, Night Lovell, Pouya, and Turnstile as openers. The tour started with a show on July 24, 2019 at the WaMu Theater in Seattle, Washington and ended on August 23, 2019 after a show at the Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>In August 2021, after a hiatus of over a year, the duo released their second studio album Long Term Effects of Suffering. The album was received well by their fans, while being divisive in general media. Shortly after the release of the album, the duo began the Grey Day Tour 2021 along with other members of G*59.

In November 2021, the duo were awarded with their first RIAA platinum single, as their hit song "...And to Those I Love, Thanks for Sticking Around" reached one million sales.</p>

MEET THE BAND </div>
<p>(On The Right) $crim was born Scott Anthony Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in Marrero, Louisiana. Arceneaux originally was inspired by T-Pain and Kanye West to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start DJing with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux's passion for DJing extended when he started to attend Delgado Community College, where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.</p>

<p>(On The Left) Ruby da Cherry was born Aristos Norman Petrou on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and Greek Cypriot father Pavlos Petrou, a former association football head coach at Mount Carmel Academy who arrived in the country after obtaining an athletic scholarship to the University of New Orleans.  Raised in Metairie, Louisiana, Petrou's interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father's restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015. His experience with the punk rock scene continued as he joined the band Vapo-Rats as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in hip-hop with Arceneaux.</p>

<p>Arceneaux and Petrou are cousins, and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn't work out, they would both commit suicide. Elaborating on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there's no plan B, that if this doesn't happen by the time we’re 30, I'm blowing my head off”.</p>
